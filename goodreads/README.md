  - `isbn`: 700 missing
  - `isbn13`: 585 missing
  - `original_publication_year`: 21 missing
  - `original_title`: 585 missing
  - `language_code`: 1084 missing

## 3. Descriptive Statistics
### Overview of Key Numerical Columns
- Average Rating: Mean = 4.00, Std Dev = 0.25
- Ratings Count: Mean = 54,001, Std Dev = 157,370
- Work Ratings Count: Mean = 59,687, Std Dev = 167,804

### Categorical Variables
- Most frequent author: Stephen King (60 books)
- Most common language code: `eng` (6,341 occurrences)

## 4. Data Visualization
### 4.1 Histograms
![Histogram](goodreads/correlation_heatmap.png)
- Showed distributions of ratings revealing right skewness for ratings count.

### 4.2 Boxplots
![Boxplot](goodreads/outlier_detection.png)
- Identified significant outliers in ratings categories (e.g., `ratings_5`).

### 4.3 Pair Plots
![Pairplot](goodreads/pairplot_analysis.png)
- Established relationships among numerical features, indicating positive correlations between ratings categories.

## 5. Correlation Analysis
### 5.1 Correlation Matrix
- High positive correlations were found between:
  - `ratings_count` and `work_ratings_count` (0.995)
  - `ratings_5` and `work_ratings_count` (0.967)

### 5.2 Insights from Correlations
- Strong correlation indicates that as the count of ratings increases, so does the count of work ratings and the average ratings in the dataset.

## 6. Anomaly Detection
### 6.1 Outlier Analysis
- Boxplots revealed numerous outliers, primarily in the ratings categories, indicating books receiving an unusually high or low number of ratings.

### 6.2 Implications
- Outliers may skew average ratings and require further investigation to determine if they signify errors or legitimate cases.

## 7. Clustering Analysis
### 7.1 K-Means Clustering
- Clusters Identified:
  - Cluster 0: 9967 entries
  - Cluster 1: 24 entries
  - Cluster 2: 9 entries

### 7.2 Insights from Clustering
- Majority of books fell into a single cluster, suggesting a general characteristic across most entries. The small clusters may represent niche books with specific attributes.

## 8. Special Analyses
### 8.1 Time-series Analysis
- No time-series features identified in the dataset.

### 8.2 Geographic Analysis
- No geographic features detected.

### 8.3 Network Analysis
- No network features evaluated.

## 9. Conclusion
The analysis of the Goodreads dataset provided valuable insights into book ratings and author popularity. Key findings included:
- Strong positive correlations between ratings variables indicate multiple ratings categories can significantly affect each other.
- Outlier detection illuminated potential data quality issues in ratings.
- Clustering suggests distinct groups among books, highlighting the potential for targeted recommendations.

## 10. Implications for Further Research
- Investigating missing values could enhance dataset quality and improve predictive analyses.
- Exploring the relationships between authors and ratings might expose trends in favorable author characteristics. 
- Future studies could also delve into temporal trends in book ratings if appropriate time-based data becomes available.

This structured approach to analyzing the Goodreads dataset lays a foundation for deeper explorative and predictive analyses, giving stakeholders a broad view of the trends and anomalies present within the data.
